# 3D visualisation and manipulation of scientific data in static web applications

## Tutorial (1 hour)

Scientific software comes in all shapes and sizes; from small scripts to large systems.

While techniques such as containerisation has simplified installation and dependency resolution, getting a program to run can still be a major hurdle for its intended end user.

This tutorial will showcase how scientific software projects, in particular those with a need for 3D visualisation, can be shared as static web apps. This way, no installation is required by the user, as they simply visit a URL. Furthermore, no backend needs to be maintained, since the processing is performed and the data is stored locally (in the client application).

Using modern frameworks such as Three.js (for webGL and webVR), Metro UI (for ribbon UI), Vega-Lite (for simple plotting), and Pyodide (for Python support).
